## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router Dom](https://reactrouter.com/web) - Routing
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - Data fetching
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I thought my grip on Axios async/await requests was solid until I ran into some issues here on how to structure my data fetching. I needed an array from the initial fetch data to perform a follow-up fetch and had all sorts of confusion with the right way to put it all together (spoiler: I still am not even 100% certain that it's the "best" way but it works).

### Continued development

Continuing off my previous note, I'd like to freshen up on async requests and really make sure I properly understand the ins and outs.
